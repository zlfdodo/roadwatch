✅ Phase 1: Core Functionality – Real-Time Monitoring
Goal: Display current hazard levels on Sea-to-Sky Hwy using live data.

Tasks:
- API Integration
    - Fetch current road events & conditions from Open511–DriveBC.
    - Get current weather observations (snowfall, temperature, wind) from DriveBC or Open-Meteo.

- Road Segmentation
    - Split the Sea-to-Sky Hwy into ~5–10 key segments (e.g., West Van → Lions Bay → Squamish → Function Junction → Whistler Village).
    - Manually define segment start/end lat/lon for now.

- Simple Hazard Classification
    - Rule-based logic: e.g.,
        - python
            if snow_depth > 5cm and temperature < 0:
                hazard = "Red"
            elif rain and temp < 1:
                hazard = "Yellow"
            else:
                hazard = "Green"

- Web Dashboard
    - Use React to show:
        - A clean map with color-coded segments
        - Timestamped data update info
        - Weather + condition summaries per segment

🚀 Phase 2: Short-Term Forecast
Goal: Add next-12-hour hazard forecast using Open-Meteo hourly forecasts.

Tasks:
- Pull hourly forecasts for segment midpoints (or interpolate).

- Apply the same rule-based logic to future hours.

- Add a forecast slider/timeline to dashboard:
    “What will conditions look like at 9am, 12pm, 3pm?”

🧠 Phase 3: ML Prediction (Optional/Future)
Use ML later to:
    - Replace rule-based classification with data-driven hazard scoring.
    - Predict incidents/closures based on weather + historical alerts.
